Identifying spam caller

This was my work as an intern in Algorithms department at Jiusuo Data Analytics

spamfilter.scala
------------------
This code was a filter to generate datasets which were reliable indicators of
spam callers which would be fed into the logistic regression model in the
classifier.scala script

classifier.scala
----------------
Uses the filtered data generated by spamfilter.scala
to train a logistic regression model

spatialcomp.scala
------------------
Finds the phones within the vicinity of a certain phone number at a certain time

linearRegressionCode.scala
---------------------------
This code is a simple iteration of linear regression used for testing
and learning purposes

Clustering.scala
-----------------
This code is a simple application of kmeans for testing purposes

travelpath.scala
----------------
This code was to find the overall spatial shift of callers over time

Run* or Train* prefixed files
-----------------------------
Used to run the Spark scripts indicated after the prefix on hadoop clusters
